					<h2>Purpose of  <span>Innovation Lab</span></h2> 
					<p>In general, we see problem as a problem, and not as an opportunity to innovate a solution. If the necessity is the mother of invention, it is important to identify, analyse and articulate the necessity. The necessity arise out of challenge, has more driving force and solution for the same in high demand. The very purpose of the Innovation Lab is to define a process to identify the potential challenges, select and enable skilled resources and aid the focus group with adequate infrastructure. </p>

					<p>We envisage the Educational institutions as the best place to host the innovation Lab. As the institution for imparting knowledge, it has the 
          inherent mission to develop skilled individuals. It is critical and complementing. In the process, Institution is also equipped with diversified infrastructures, which can be leveraged, without recreate. The institution's wealth of knowledge and their faculties become an integral part of the Lab.</p>

        <p>The Lab mainly focus on a real-life challenges, which may attract multi disciplinary approach. The prevailing college/institution are mainly focus around departmental facilities, focused on individual verticals. The Innovation Lab brings a convergence of technologies and enable to think and envisage cross-functional engineering to solve a problem. This is the amazing part of incubating the innovation Lab within the Institution facility and builds it as an integral part of the system. </p>
