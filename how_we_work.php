            <h1>Modality of formation</h1>
            <p>The Innovation Lab is a legal entity, preferably as a Charitable trust [Not for profit] under the main trust/holding of the institution. The Innovation Lab should have a designated place within the institution with prominence. It is expected to allocate a location for Innovation Lab, which can easily accommodate 20-25 students, ~5 faculty members, 2-3 consultants and 1-2 industrial representative at any point. It must have its own governing body, as detail here after. The Innovation Lab as a NFP entity, may hold equity in the company formed out of the entrepreneur endeavour. It expect to have minimal of 12% equity share at formation. The Lab will hold the IP in sharing with its innovator and have the legal right. It shall be funded completely and adequately by the institution's main trust.  </p>

          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="topics">               
            <h1>Process of selection - Topics </h1>
           <p>We respect every individuals and their thoughts and idea. Even though it is important to enlist all, Lab will set the criteria for enrolment and then the selection.

		<li> Arena of current impact, </li>
		<li>Possible benefit towards excellence, </li>
		<li>Assessment of required skill & infrastructure to build the solution/design, </li>
		<li>Why institute should fund this initiative [25 words]. </li></ul>

          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="methodology">               
            <h1>Process of selection - Methodology </h1>
           <p>The selection process can be outline broadly around the following and may not be limited to these: </p>

          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="industries">               
            <h1>Process of association - Industries </h1>
           <p>Innovation Lab constantly need the deep association with technology industries, ranging from diversified field and region. At initial stage, the criteria can be derived based on the feasibility and later in maturity, this can be planned as desired by governing body. </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="enhancement">               
            <h1>Process of enablement - Skill enhancement </h1>
           <p>The student needs to be equipped with relevant technology and skills to be more effective in the process. This required extensive training, in form of enablement. We primarily focus of the IT related training in versus decline and later will expand in the more diversified engineering streams, based on multi disciplinary innovation. </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="Social">               
            <h1>Process of publishing & Social Media Interaction</h1>
           <p>This is a critical interaction point from Innovation Lab to the world. The effective use with moderate censorship can help to attract industry and world to see our creativity. Every individual must have the right for social media integration towards innovation. The Innovation Lab must have its own authorised channel to promote the process. Institution and Lab should constantly work together to bring relevant articles in publish media and online, by the help of Principal, HoD and faculty members, in a regular defined intervals. It helps to gain tremendous millage in Institution's branding. </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="tab-pane fade" id="rd">               
            <h1>Modality of continuity as R&D</h1>
           <p>Innovation Lab is not a project management house, neither govern innovation as a project. Innovation needs to be exploratory and creative, with wide spectrum of thoughts and possibilities. Imposing a timeline to this could hamper the process of research. But, as the time and resources are finite , it has to have a boundary condition in terms of budget and timeline. This shall be planned for each challenge and shall be subject to approval of governing council in every quarter. </p>
