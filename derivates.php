					<p>The right derivative of any innovation is a solution of technology excellence, which solve a prevailing challenge and/or create a disruptive opportunity. It is a constant process and journey of itself. Though it is more of long terms and qualitatively experience driven, we need to have the followings to shape our focus. Here is an inverted funnel of derivatives. </p>

            <h1>Presenter </h1>
            <p>The systematic enablement process must cultivate every individuals in the Lab as a great presenter. The members of faculty and the student must be equally empowered and trying to articulate their thoughts in a well reprinted manner. The communication hold a key strength, which needs to be developed, by means of interaction, coaching, team work, activities, ideation, language training, graphical representation, presentation etc. In a maturity, all individuals must have their video profile, in well groomed manner.  </p>

            <h1>Designer </h1>
            <p>One can only solve a problem, when he can analyse the challenge and able to design the various possible solutions, logically. The design requires the consideration of aesthetics, functional, economic, socio political dimension of the both design object and design process. The Lab will inculcate the design philosophy, to be determine the design goal. The Design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of smallest element, to most holistic influential utopian goal. The student shall be enabled with the preliminary skill towards a professional implementation. </p>

            <h1>Technologist </h1>
           <p>The reality of a solution is created in the hand of technologist, by skill and craftsmanship. The Lab will have the system in place to asses the gap in required skill and adequately  enable the individuals to be proficient. This encompass the domain knowledge and disciplinary skills. Lab will form the macro plan between the members to exchange and collaborate for the enhancement. In a maturity, the students from the lab will have the domain expertise of the interest and carry forward that as a key street and skill in their professional life. A research scholar will be the best possible outcome, the lab can contribute.

           <p>Lab will focus on excellence in all sphere and be generically inclusive in modality. Lab will focus of the solution relevant to the social economical challenges and creating a self sustainable product or solution. In this process, The solution may achieve a significant revenue model, which can enable the individual to be an early entrepreneur. Even though the lab will remain the NFP centre, it will inculcate the business acumen within individual to explore the product and solution design in the wider perspective. This brings the job creation and satisfaction of independence within individuals.  </p>

            <h1>Innovator - [IPR] </h1>
           <p>The ultimate achievement of the Lab would be have significant number of IPR filled and listed in wipo.int in the name of students and institutions. This need the proper understanding of techno-legal understanding of the over all subject matters and capability to envisage futuristic solution in a relevant context. It also need a minimal working prototype to proof a viability and feasibility of the solutions of given challenge. This process will enable individual student to think out of the box, creatively and unique possible way to find a solution. Being associated with a filed patent will surely enhance the profile of the student. The enhanced profile may attract larger industries to employ and/or adopt the research. This is longer and difficult milestone to achieve and should be planned and targeted accordingly. </p>

            <h1>Emergence of an Inclusive model  </h1>
           <p>The inclusive model of innovation is to build a winder ecosystem for Innovation lab. apart from its versatile stakeholders, the Lab need to have the participative association with various industries in collaborative manner. It has to be derived from the decline specific verticals and industries and there future roadmap. The Innovation Lab also need to be networked with other education institution's similar or equivalent initiative in regular manner. While the Lab has stringent selection for top 25 students, it also allows remaining student to be the contributors under the leadership of the selective 25 members. It bring the required leadership, team work and collaborative and complementing ecosystem.  </p>
