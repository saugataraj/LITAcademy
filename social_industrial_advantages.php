					<h2>Innovation  <span>Lab</span></h2>
					<p>Innovation Lab is an extremely effort intensive, resource consuming, long term focused initiative. There are many uncertainty and variability in this endeavour. As the  consultant to this endeavour, we play the role of catalyst. We contribute our time, towards building a systematic process and system of innovation with the institution. We trust that, anybody can innovate, given a chance and resource with guidance. We are overwhelmed by the recent start-up initiative in India and actively associated in many process. We envisage that the young minds in colleges can bring the technology revolution in the country and we are dedicated to drive that change. Placement, job offers are no more a target for institution, if we effective innovate with student and associate them to social challenges. We want to make a job seeker to a job creator of tomorrow. We want student to present their research confidently in an interview. We want industry to select research, not researcher. We want social innovation to start right from colleges, and may be from schools tomorrow.  </p>
                    <p>We envisage a future, as Rabindranath Tagore wrote:</p>
                    <p>
" Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br>
Where knowledge is free;<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
By narrow domestic walls<br>
Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
Into ever-widening thought and action;<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, My Father, let my country awake. "
